title: Media Backup Information
---

The media backup makes use of the Plex extension called [Export tools](https://github.com/ukdtom/ExportTools.bundle). The extension is installed and the files are exported as csv files and they are zipped.
Currently, the files are exported to Google drive.

The process creates two csv files, one for TV shows and one for Movies.

The script that can be used to extract important information from this can be found inside this folder.
