title: Media Conversion
---

The aim of this is to create a system that will automatically convert all media on the system to mp4 format with H264 encoding so that more devices can directly run the files without having to transcode them.

The use of MKV is preferred over MP4 as it supports more audio channels and also has the ability to support higher resolutions.
The MKV format may not be best for older media players, however, this will change over time as those older units fall out of usage.
